# Character-Level-Language-Model
I have constructed a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network will train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. As an example, I will train on Anna Karenina. This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the book.
<p> The network is based on Andrej Karpathy's <a href="karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">post on RNNs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn"> implementation in Torch.</a> </p>
<p> This code implements multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models. In other words the model takes one text file as input and trains a Recurrent Neural Network that learns to predict the next character in a sequence. The RNN can then be used to generate text character by character that will look like the original training data. </p>
